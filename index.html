<p>I've always been into programming since I was little.  When I was 8 I coded a choose your own adventure on DOS (basic) which were nested if statements "You see two doors, do you enter the one on the left or right?"
<br><br>
I moved onto ActionScript and Flash at 13,
<br><br>
Myspace happened at 15 so I learned HTML and CSS but decided to learn JavaScript as well as basic internet security.
<br><br>
I tried visual basic at 16 but really did not resonate with it.
<br><br>
I love to program and find myself very relaxed and calm around source code.  SQL is my favorite language and it's honestly really fun to write.
<br><br>
For me that's why I love computer Science: programming is fun!  I feel accomplished from figuring out the algorithm needed, proud when I get the output expected, and I think very much in terms of logic and efficiency.
<br><br>
I hope I can learn as much as I can to become an amazing programmer!
