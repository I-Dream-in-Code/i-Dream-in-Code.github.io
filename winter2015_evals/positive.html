<div>
	<ul>
	<li>Approachable, accessible, very helpful </li>
<li>he is very patient and helpful</li>
<li>Mike is by far the most helpful person in the lab. He doesn't EVER make me feel like a burden, even if I am asking him something super simple or if he has answered the same question 50 times that day already, He is incredibly patient and it is clear that he not only understands the material, but also how to interact with students. Mike would make a SUPERB full time professor.</li>
<li>He's very outgoing and happy-go-lucky. He laughs and smiles a lot. He's also respectful when explaining concepts to students and his confidence in his abilities makes me prefer his help over some of the other TA's.</li>
<li>Explained things much better than GTF. Michael seemed to have a better way of explaining to students that were having difficulties with subject matter .</li>
<li>He is really willing to help you if you have a problem and understands all the material he is instructing.</li>
<li>always ready to help whoever needs it.</li>

<li>"Energetic Engaging Enthusiastic Knowledgeable Approachable Friendly"</li>
<li>He's very clear in explaining and teaching. He knows the subject very well. He's friendly and understanding. 
Mike is very helpful. Most of the time in the lab, he suggests errors, comparisons and explains things more clear that students do not know about, that the actual lab instructor does not  discuss. I would prefer for Mike to be a lab instructor than my current lab instructor.</li>
<li>gives us all the proper respect, is very patient</li>
<li>all around a good person</li>
<li>Mike is an approachable and friendly TA. He is always available when I need him and is patient when explaining. Mike is always prepared to help during office hours and lab. He is the only TA that takes the time to make sure I understand the code and am not left confused. </li>
<li>Michael is very easy to get along with and is very approachable. He is very helpful and is very good at what he does. He is always willing to help. He also makes sure we completely understand the concepts before moving on with new material which is a very positive quality. </li>

<li>Michael is a super nice guy who seems to be extremely knowledgeable on all the topics that are covered in 110. He has successfully helped me in understanding and completing many of my projects.</li>
<li>Michael seems to be one of the few GTF's that is actually confident about his direction and teaching. My lab instructor who is not Michael literally did not know how to explain over half my questions so I gave up going to that guy and starting only coming to office hours because I knew Michael would there to help. Because of him I have gotten 100% on all my projects.</li>
<li>Attentive and super helpful! </li>
