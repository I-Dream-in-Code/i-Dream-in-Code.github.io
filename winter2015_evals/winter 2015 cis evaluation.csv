He doesn't EVER make me feel like a burden, even if I am asking him something super simple or if he has answered the same question 50 times that day already, He is incredibly patient and it is clear that he not only understands the material, but also how to interact with students. Mike would make a SUPERB full time professor.",
He's very outgoing and happy-go-lucky. He laughs and smiles a lot. He's also respectful when explaining concepts to students and his confidence in his abilities makes me prefer his help over some of the other TA's.,

all around a good person",

My lab instructor who is not Michael literally did not know how to explain over half my questions so I gave up going to that guy and starting only coming to office hours because I knew Michael would there to help. Because of him I have gotten 100% on all my projects.,
Attentive and super helpful! ,

14.  What are the negative qualities of Michael?
Text Response,
Honestly I have nothing to write here. He is immensely helpful and incredibly friendly.,
Sometimes he comes across as though he feels that all students just want him to do their work for them. I'm sure some students have that attitude but not all of us do so it's pretty offensive when the unethical behaviors of those students are generalized to be representative of all studentkind.,
"He should be teaching our section, found him more helpful than GTF ",
"Goes through lab a little bit rushed, causing many students to be lost and confused.",
i have known Michael since the beginning of this term and he has no negative attributes towards anybody.,

N/A,
Nothing.,
He is in high demand so sometimes it's hard to get his attention.,
