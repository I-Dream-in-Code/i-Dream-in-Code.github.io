	<h2>How can Michael improve?</h2><hr>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>N/A</li>
<li>Maybe co-teach with GTF . </li>
<li>He could explain the purpose of each lab at the beginning so students have an idea of what they're doing.</li>
<li>more hours to help students.</li>
<li>just explain more</li>
<li>Not get sick next time so he's in lab more. :p</li>
<li>Move a little slower, explain things a little more</li>
<li>none</li>
<li>Make himself more available? Not much room for improvement, he was a good gtf.</li>
<li>Do your best to help and support students who are completely lost on an assignment. Using simple language and walking them through it can be helpful.</li>
<li>He could make copies of himself.</li>
<li>By continuing the work he does during the lab hours.</li>
<li>he was great!!!!</li>
<li>Take more time for himself</li>
<li>N/A</li>
<li>Needs more office hours so he can help more people</li>
<li>None</li>
<li>keeping up with the good work.</li>
<li>Grow back the mohawk cause I never got to see </li>
<li>I think Michael should be offered more office hours if he were willing. I think he is very beneficial to students and this would be in the departments best interest.</li>
<li>Does great how he does it</li>
<li>N/A</li>
